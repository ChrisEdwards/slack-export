# slack-export configuration
# Copy this file to slack-export.yaml and customize for your needs.
#
# Config file search order:
#   1. Path specified via --config flag
#   2. ./slack-export.yaml (current directory)
#   3. ~/.config/slack-export/slack-export.yaml
#
# Environment variables with SLACK_EXPORT_ prefix override file values.
# Example: SLACK_EXPORT_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/logs

# Directory where exported logs are written.
# Each channel gets a subdirectory with dated markdown files.
# Default: ./slack-logs
output_dir: ./slack-logs

# Timezone for date boundaries when splitting logs by day.
# Uses IANA timezone names (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/London", "UTC").
# Messages are grouped into daily files based on this timezone.
# Default: America/New_York
timezone: America/New_York

# Channel include patterns (glob syntax).
# Only channels matching at least one pattern are exported.
# If empty, all channels are included (subject to exclude patterns).
# Patterns are case-insensitive and support * and ? wildcards.
#
# Examples:
#   - "eng-*"      # All channels starting with "eng-"
#   - "*-team"     # All channels ending with "-team"
#   - "project-?"  # project-a, project-b, etc.
include:
  # - "eng-*"
  # - "ai-*"
  # - "_dm_*"

# Channel exclude patterns (glob syntax).
# Channels matching any pattern are skipped, even if they match include patterns.
# Useful for filtering out noisy automated channels.
#
# Examples:
#   - "*-deploys"  # Skip deployment notification channels
#   - "_app_*"     # Skip app/bot channels
#   - "*-alerts"   # Skip alert channels
exclude:
  # - "*-deploys"
  # - "_app_*"
  # - "*-alerts"

# Path to slackdump executable (optional).
# If not set, slack-export looks for 'slackdump' in PATH.
# Useful if slackdump is installed in a non-standard location.
# slackdump_path: /usr/local/bin/slackdump
